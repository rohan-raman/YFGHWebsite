Rohan is a student at South Brunswick High School and is one of the four founding members of YFGH. He first gained interest in global health after joining his school's public health club in 2021 and volunteering at its blood drives. Rohan loves to volunteer, and he started South Brunswick CoderDojo, a student-run coding club where dedicated high school students teach youth in elementary and middle school how to code. Rohan also enjoys volunteering for the South Brunswick Soccer Club's Buddy Ball program for youth with special needs. He hopes to study biomedical engineering in college.
