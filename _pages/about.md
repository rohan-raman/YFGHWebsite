Founded in April 2023, the Youth Foundation for Global Health (YFGH) is an nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization incubated under [Hack+](https://hackplus.io/) dedicated to empowering youth in the realm of global health education and activism. We seek to give ambitious young individuals the necessary tools, resources, and opportunities to drive meaningful change.
