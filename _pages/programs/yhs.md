Inform the world on global health by presenting in Youth Health Speakers (YHS)
{: .text-center}

# What is YHS?

Youth Health Speakers is a **speaker-series** for high school students to raise awareness and disseminate information on global health to the general public.

Students can submit their presentations year-round, and once accepted, they are given the chance to **present live and share their work online**. This gives students experience in global health advocacy, taking a direct role in educating the community on complex global health issues. 

# Who should submit to YHS?

Anyone can submit to YHS, even those who don't have experience! All you need is an interest and dedication to your topic. Our requirements are designed with high school students in mind, and we ensure that all students have the resources needed to make an impact.

YHS is intended for a **general audience, not a scientific one**, and is meant to educate on current events. If you are interested in researching and producing scientific reports instead, consider the [Youth Health Review](/programs/yhr/).

# How can I submit?
Please consult our submission guidelines for all submission procedures and guidelines.
